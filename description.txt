Terra factory is a large overhaul mod for terraria where you create a large factory to create resources, and defend your base against bosses to progress.
It is not compatible with most other overhaul mods and is a complete shift in playstyle. Do not pair with other mods featuring world generation, it won't work.

The mod is currently in development, this version is an InDev playable vertical slice.

Please come back later!
